          Retirement marks a significant transition in life, especially for
          public servants who have dedicated years to serving the community.
          However, this new chapter can be daunting due to the unpredictable
          nature of pension disbursements and the often harsh economic climate.
          That&apos;s why it&apos;s essential to consider entrepreneurship
          before hanging up your hat.

          <strong>The Risks of Post-Retirement</strong> Start-ups Starting a
          business after retirement might seem like a natural step, but it comes
          with considerable risks:
        </p>
        <ul className='mx-5'>
          <li>
            <strong>Financial Instability:</strong> Pensions may not always
            cover living expenses, let alone the costs associated with launching
            a new venture.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Market Unpredictability:</strong> Without prior market
            research, new retirees can find themselves investing in unprofitable
            markets.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Time Management:</strong> Adjusting to the demands of a new
            business can be overwhelming without the structure of a regular job.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Why Start Before Retirement?</p>
        <ol className='ml-5'>
          <li>
            <strong>Test the Waters:</strong> Starting a business 5-6 years
            before retirement allows you to understand the market and customer
            needs.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Balance Commitments:</strong> It ensures your new venture
            doesn&apos;t conflict with your current job responsibilities.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Gain Insights:</strong> You&apos;ll get a realistic preview
            of the time and effort required to run your business full-time.
